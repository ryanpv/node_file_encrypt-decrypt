mkdir for project folder and cd into it
npx create-react-app client
mkdir for server
cd into server and npm init -y
npm install mongodb express cors dotenv

while in server folder, create server.js to create your server (PORT)
create a db folder inside server folder and create a js file to connect to mongodb
create another folder called routes inside server folder and create a js file to store your routes

then go back to front end - folders should be available because of react app client
